              My research delved into fluid dynamics in zero-gravity environments, where traditional experiments are often expensive and logistically challenging. 
              To overcome these obstacles, we employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. These simulations allowed us to study fluid behavior in zero gravity 
              without the need for costly physical experiments.  
              One crucial aspect we considered was the influence of Earth's gravity on fluid dynamics. 
              On Earth, gravity significantly affects how fluids move. In our simulations, we incorporated equations to account 
              for this influence. This research enhanced our understanding of fluid behavior in zero gravity and has applications 
              in aerospace and space exploration.
